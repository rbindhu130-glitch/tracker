      <p>Towards a Safer, More Aware Community</p>

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        In many cities, people face <span class="highlight">harassment, stalking,</span> and
        <span class="highlight">unsafe environments</span> while traveling.
        These experiences often create fear and restrict freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea for SafeTracker began with Anu — a working professional in Chennai who travels home alone every night.
        Dark streets, lack of streetlights, and unsafe surroundings made every journey a challenge.
        Like Anu, thousands of women, students, and elderly citizens face similar dangers every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        We wanted to change that. SafeTracker was built to give people a voice, a tool, and a community
        where help is just a click away.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        To create a platform that empowers individuals to report unsafe situations, connect with nearby volunteers,
        and access reliable safety resources — all in real time.
      </p>

      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Enable users to <strong>report incidents</strong> and request help instantly.</li>
        <li>Connect verified <strong>volunteers</strong> to those in need nearby.</li>
        <li>Provide <strong>safety resources</strong> like helplines and police station info.</li>
        <li>Track and analyze <strong>high-risk areas</strong> to improve community safety.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Who We Serve</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>People at Risk:</strong> Anyone who feels unsafe in public spaces — women, students, elders, and
          travelers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Volunteers:</strong> Verified individuals willing to help and ensure safe journeys for others.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>
        A city where every person — no matter their gender, age, or time of travel —
        feels <strong>safe, supported, and confident</strong> to move freely.
